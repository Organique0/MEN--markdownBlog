I have tried to host this on Vercel but that turned out to not be that easy. So I gave up and reseted all commits, which also took me a while to figure out how to do. nice.
Maybe I could host this somewhere else but other options are usually not free.

OK, the app is now hosted on Heroku : https://markdown-blog-64-be0fe7ddd829.herokuapp.com/
I know that it is insane to do that, but I just like to host everything because what is the point otherwise? 
It took 3 hours at least, trying to make it work, so you better visit this beautifull site.
